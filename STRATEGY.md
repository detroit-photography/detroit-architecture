# Detroit Photography: Strategic Vision & Prime Directive

> **Last Updated:** December 15, 2024  
> **Purpose:** Guide all development decisions and provide context for AI agents and collaborators

---

## Executive Summary

Detroit Photography is a portrait photography business with a strategic content play: building **the definitive online database of Detroit's historic architecture**. This is not a content farm or AI-generated SEO play—it is a serious effort to surface authentic historic documents that have never been accessible online.

**The money is in portraiture. The moat is in architecture content.**

### The Core Mission
We are building a resource that:
- **Every Detroiter** can use to look up the history of buildings in their city
- **Researchers and journalists** can cite as a primary source
- **History enthusiasts** will bookmark and return to
- **Google** will recognize as the authoritative answer for hundreds of local queries

### What This Is NOT
- ❌ AI-generated content or "SEO slop"
- ❌ Thin pages designed to game search engines
- ❌ Rewritten Wikipedia articles
- ❌ Generic architectural descriptions

### What This IS
- ✅ Primary source documents (NRHP nominations) digitized and structured
- ✅ Authentic historic photographs from government archives
- ✅ Original professional photography we own the copyright to
- ✅ A citable, referenceable database of real historic information

---

## Business Model

### Primary Revenue: Portrait Photography
- Professional headshots (starting at $149)
- Corporate team photography
- Executive portraits
- LinkedIn profile photos
- Branding photography sessions

### Secondary Revenue: Architecture
- Fine art print sales of Detroit architecture
- Licensing of architectural photography
- (Future) Guided photography tours

### The Strategic Bridge
Architecture enthusiasts who discover the site through historic building content are the exact demographic that hires portrait photographers:
- Professionals who care about aesthetics
- Executives at Detroit companies
- People connected to Detroit's history and identity
- Individuals with disposable income for quality photography

---

## The NRHP Content Strategy

### What is NRHP?
The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the official list of historic properties in the United States. Each listed property has a **nomination document** (PDF) containing:
- Detailed architectural descriptions
- Historical significance statements
- Original construction dates and architects
- **Historic photographs** (often from the early 1900s)
- Maps and site plans

**Critical insight:** This content is public domain and can be used for any purpose, but it's buried in government PDFs that Google cannot index. We are digitizing and structuring this content.

### Authentic Sources, Not AI Slop

**This is the most important principle of the architecture database.**

We are unearthing and presenting **authentic historic documents**—not generating content. Every piece of text on a building page should be:

1. **Directly quoted** from the NRHP nomination (with citation)
2. **Factual information** extracted from official records
3. **Our own original writing** based on primary source research
4. **Never AI-generated filler** or rewritten Wikipedia content

#### Why This Matters
- **Credibility:** Researchers, journalists, and historians can cite us
- **Uniqueness:** This content literally doesn't exist online in accessible form
- **Trust:** Users learn they can rely on our information
- **Longevity:** Authentic content doesn't get penalized by algorithm updates

#### Citation Format
Every building page should cite its sources:
```
Source: National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, 
[Building Name], [Date Listed]. National Park Service, 
U.S. Department of the Interior.
```

### The Content Moat
By extracting, structuring, and presenting NRHP data in an SEO-friendly format, we create:

1. **Primary source documents** - The actual text from NRHP nominations, citable and authoritative
2. **Unique historic images** - Scanned photographs from nomination documents (public domain)
3. **Original photography** - Our own copyrighted modern photos of these buildings
4. **Structured data** - Architect, style, year, neighborhood relationships that enable discovery
5. **Local authority** - Detroit-specific focus with professional local presence

### The Definitive Database Goal

We want this database to be **the place Detroiters go** to learn about their city's architecture. Not just for SEO—for genuine utility.

When someone wonders "What's the history of that building on Woodward?", they should find us. When a journalist needs to fact-check an architect's name, they should cite us. When a student writes a paper on Detroit's Art Deco heritage, they should reference us.

**If we build something genuinely useful, the SEO follows.**

### Competitive Advantage
| Factor | Wikipedia | HistoricDetroit.org | DetroitUrbex | **Us** |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| Complete NRHP data | Partial | Some | No | **Yes** |
| Professional photos | No | Limited | Good | **Yes** |
| Structured database | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Local business presence | No | No | No | **Yes** |

## Content Architecture

### Building Pages (`/architecture/building/[id]`)
Each historic building gets a dedicated page with:
- Hero image (our photo if available, historic if not)
- Quick facts (year, architect, style, status)
- Historical significance (from NRHP nomination)
- Image gallery (mixing historic + modern)
- Interactive map
- Nearby buildings
- Links to architect's other works
- CTA for portrait sessions at this or similar locations

### Aggregate Pages
- **By Neighborhood:** Corktown, Midtown, Downtown, New Center, etc.
- **By Architect:** Albert Kahn, Minoru Yamasaki, Wirt Rowland, etc.
- **By Style:** Art Deco, Romanesque Revival, Beaux-Arts, etc.
- **By Era:** 1900s, 1920s, 1960s, etc.
- **Curated Lists:** "Detroit's Most Photographed Buildings," "Hidden Gems," etc.

### Blog/Guide Content
- Deep-dive articles on specific buildings
- Architect profiles and legacy pieces
- Neighborhood architecture guides
- "Best locations for portrait photography"
- Walking tour guides

## SEO Strategy: Informational Intent at Scale

### The Goal: Hundreds to Thousands of Ranking Keywords

Every single building entry should rank for informational intent queries. We are not competing for "Detroit photographer" (commercial intent)—we are building authority through **informational dominance**.

### Keyword Math

Consider the scale:
- **~300 NRHP-listed properties** in Wayne County
- Each property generates **5-10 keyword variations**
- Plus **aggregate pages** (neighborhoods, architects, styles, eras)
- Plus **long-tail queries** we'll discover through Search Console

**Conservative estimate: 1,500-3,000 rankable keywords**, all locally grouped around Detroit architecture.

### Keyword Categories

#### Building-Specific (Primary Targets)
| Pattern | Example | Intent |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `[Building Name]` | "Fisher Building" | Informational |
| `[Building Name] Detroit` | "Fisher Building Detroit" | Informational |
| `[Building Name] history` | "Fisher Building history" | Informational |
| `[Building Name] architect` | "Fisher Building architect" | Informational |
| `[Building Name] interior` | "Fisher Building interior" | Informational |
| `[Building Name] photos` | "Fisher Building photos" | Informational |
| `who built [Building Name]` | "who built the Fisher Building" | Informational |
| `when was [Building Name] built` | "when was the Fisher Building built" | Informational |

#### Architect-Specific
| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `[Architect Name] buildings` | "Albert Kahn buildings" |
| `[Architect Name] Detroit` | "Albert Kahn Detroit" |
| `[Architect Name] architecture` | "Albert Kahn architecture" |
| `buildings designed by [Architect]` | "buildings designed by Albert Kahn" |

#### Location/Aggregate
| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `historic buildings in [Neighborhood]` | "historic buildings in Corktown" |
| `[Style] buildings Detroit` | "Art Deco buildings Detroit" |
| `[Era] architecture Detroit` | "1920s architecture Detroit" |
| `oldest buildings in Detroit` | — |
| `most beautiful buildings in Detroit` | — |

#### Research/Reference
| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `Detroit architecture history` | — |
| `National Register Detroit` | — |
| `historic preservation Detroit` | — |

### Why Every Entry Must Rank

Each building page is an **entry point** to the site. A researcher looking up "Guardian Building history" finds our page, sees it's comprehensive and well-sourced, then:
1. Explores other buildings (engagement)
2. Notices we're a photography studio (brand awareness)
3. Maybe needs a headshot someday (conversion)

Even if only 0.1% convert, **volume × quality = results**.

### The Local Grouping Advantage

All of these keywords share one thing: **Detroit specificity**. Google understands topical authority. A site that comprehensively covers Detroit architecture will rank higher for Detroit architecture queries than a site with scattered national content.

We're not competing with ArchDaily or Architectural Digest. We're competing with—and beating—local sites that have incomplete data or poor presentation.

- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Image Optimization:** Next.js Image with AVIF/WebP
- **Maps:** Leaflet

### URL Structure (Critical for SEO)

**URLs must be semantic and include place names.** Never use numeric IDs in user-facing URLs.

#### Building Pages
```
✅ /architecture/fisher-building
✅ /architecture/guardian-building
✅ /architecture/michigan-central-station

❌ /architecture/building/123
❌ /architecture/building?id=fisher
```

#### Architect Pages
```
✅ /architecture/architects/albert-kahn
✅ /architecture/architects/minoru-yamasaki

❌ /architecture/architect/45
```

#### Neighborhood Pages
```
✅ /architecture/neighborhoods/corktown
✅ /architecture/neighborhoods/midtown
✅ /architecture/neighborhoods/new-center
```

#### Style Pages
```
✅ /architecture/styles/art-deco
✅ /architecture/styles/romanesque-revival
✅ /architecture/styles/beaux-arts
```

#### Why This Matters
1. **SEO:** Keywords in URLs are a ranking signal
2. **Shareability:** `/architecture/fisher-building` is self-explanatory when shared
3. **Trust:** Users can see where they're going before clicking
4. **Memorability:** People can type URLs directly

#### Slug Generation Rules
- Lowercase, hyphenated: `fisher-building` not `Fisher_Building`
- Include "detroit" only when disambiguation is needed
- Remove articles: `guardian-building` not `the-guardian-building`
- Be specific: `michigan-central-station` not `mcs`

## The Portrait-Architecture Bridge

### On Architecture Pages
Every architecture page should include subtle but present CTAs:
- "Book a portrait session at this historic location"
- "We photograph people in Detroit's most beautiful buildings"
- Link to `/book` or `#pricing`

### Location-Based Service Pages
Create landing pages targeting:
- "Headshots at the Fisher Building"
- "Executive portraits in historic Detroit"
- "Unique headshot locations in Detroit"

### The Studio Location Advantage
We operate out of **Bagley Mansion** (John N. Bagley House), which is itself on the National Register of Historic Places. This creates a perfect narrative:
- "We're so passionate about Detroit's architecture that we work in a National Historic Landmark"
- The studio is a destination, not just a backdrop
- Clients experience history while getting professional portraits

## Content Pipeline

### Phase 1: Data Acquisition
1. Download all Wayne County NRHP nomination PDFs (~200-300 properties)
2. Prioritize Detroit city properties
3. Store in `/data/nrhp/pdfs/`

### Phase 2: Data Extraction
1. Parse PDFs to extract:
   - Building name, address
   - Year built, architect, style
   - Significance statement (Section 8 of NRHP form)
   - Historic photographs
2. Store structured data in Supabase
3. Store extracted images in `/data/nrhp/images/`

### Phase 3: Content Enrichment
1. Match buildings with our own photography
2. Add modern context (current use, recent news)
3. Create neighborhood and architect groupings
4. Write additional editorial content

### Phase 4: SEO Optimization
1. Schema.org markup for `LandmarksOrHistoricalBuildings`
2. Internal linking (building → architect → neighborhood)
3. Dynamic sitemap generation
4. Open Graph images for social sharing

### Phase 5: Scale
1. Expand to Oakland and Macomb counties
2. Add user-contributed photos (moderated)
3. Build "Recently Demolished" memorial section
4. Partner with local history organizations for backlinks

## Principles for Development

### 1. Content Quality Over Quantity
One deeply researched building page beats ten shallow ones. Each page should provide genuine value that can't be found elsewhere.

### 2. Photography First
We are photographers. Every page should showcase visual excellence. If we don't have a good photo of a building, the historic images should be presented beautifully.

### 3. Local Authenticity
This is a Detroit project by a Detroit photographer. The voice should be knowledgeable, passionate, and locally rooted—not generic SEO content.

### 4. Sustainable Architecture
Build for the long term. Clean code, proper database design, and maintainable content structures. This site should still work and be updatable in 5 years.

### 5. The Bridge is Natural
Never force the portrait upsell. The connection between "we document Detroit's architecture" and "we photograph Detroit's people" should feel organic and credible.

### 6. Performance Matters
Fast page loads, optimized images, proper caching. Mobile-first design. Our audience may be browsing on phones while walking past these buildings.

## For AI Agents: Key Context

When working on this codebase, remember:

### Content Philosophy (CRITICAL)

1. **NO AI-GENERATED CONTENT for architecture pages.** All building descriptions must come from authentic sources (NRHP nominations, historical records). Do not write creative descriptions of buildings. Extract and present real documents.

2. **Cite sources.** Every fact should be traceable to a primary source. Include citations on building pages.

3. **Semantic URLs always.** Never use numeric IDs in URLs. Use slugs like `/architecture/fisher-building`.

4. **Every page should rank.** Architecture pages target informational intent. Include proper H1s, meta descriptions, and schema markup.

### Technical Context

5. **Dual purpose:** This site serves both portrait photography clients AND architecture enthusiasts. Don't break either experience.

6. **NRHP is the secret weapon:** The `/data/nrhp/` folder contains public domain gold. Treat this content extraction as a core priority.

7. **SEO matters:** Every architecture page is a potential search entry point. Proper meta tags, schema markup, and semantic HTML are essential.

8. **The studio is Bagley Mansion:** References to "our studio" or "the mansion" refer to the John N. Bagley House, a National Historic Landmark at 2921 E Jefferson Ave.

9. **Deployment pattern:** Always deploy to Vercel first (`npx vercel --prod`), then commit and push to GitHub. This is faster than waiting for GitHub webhooks.

10. **Large files:** PDFs in `/data/nrhp/pdfs/` are git-ignored due to size. Don't try to commit them.

11. **The owner is Andrew Petrov:** Professional photographer, architecture enthusiast, and the creative vision behind this project.
